Based on the latest market data from March 2025, I'll outline the industry pricing frameworks for content moderation services and create a tailored pricing proposal.

## Content Moderation Industry Pricing Frameworks

Content moderation services typically follow several pricing models:

**Per-Unit Pricing**
- Image moderation: $0.22-$0.6 per 1,000 images[1][4][7]

- Audio moderation: $0.04-$0.136 per hour (tiered based on volume)[7]

**Volume-Based Tiered Pricing**
Most providers offer discounts as volume increases. For example, Tencent's image moderation pricing[7]:
- ≤3 million: $0.22/1,000 images
- 3-15 million: $0.20/1,000 images
- 15-30 million: $0.18/1,000 images

**Hourly Rate Pricing**
- Industry average: $50-$99 per hour for content moderation services[1]

**Subscription/Package Pricing**
- Basic plans starting around $99/month for small businesses[2]
- Enterprise solutions typically require custom quotes
