# Info about da hive

These are all [markdown.md]([url](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)) files 

If you haven seen them b4 - you likely will at this company ! 

Usually used for documentation - has a couple of nice **tricks** for *formatting*

### Respository Structure

I asked gpt to generate a series of prompts for perplexity to get the information for the assignment

I would start by checking out `prompts.md` ~ this is the series of prompts I fed into perplexity

You can see the answer to each prompt in `perplexity/`

And finally - I took all the responses from perplexity - fed them back into gpt & asked for a comprehensive document

You can see that result at `document.md`
